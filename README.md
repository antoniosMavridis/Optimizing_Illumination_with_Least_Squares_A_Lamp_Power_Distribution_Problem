# Optimizing_Illumination_with_Least_Squares_A_Lamp_Power_Distribution_Problem
This repository focuses on optimizing area illumination using a set of lamps, employing the least squares method. It includes code for calculating optimal lamp powers, visualizing illumination patterns, and handling constraints like energy limits. Additional challenges involve optimizing lamp positions for improved results.
